# Lifeclip

## Why??

Most time as a developer, I often have to visit several documentations and articles again just to copy some important content. Being frusrated by this, I decided to build a web solution where I can clip important contents and get them later anywhere and on any device as long as I am signed in with my Gmail account.

## What it does

Its Simple, All it does is clip any content you want it to. Clipped contents can be retreived later by easily clicking the copy button. You can also have access to clipped contents anywhere and on any device as long as you are signed in. You can also update clipped contents, and also remove and add search tags. Contents which are not needed can however be deleted too. All in all, it is a no stress website. Its beautiful, simple and fast!

## What next?

Several updates in both UI and UX will be coming along soon as I will be working to make this better everyday.
